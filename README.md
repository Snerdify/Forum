# Forum
Web development project
🐾This project was created for my 1st year PBL subject. It is a discussion forum built for the purpose of helping students get correct info about the college if they wish to take admission. It would also help students from 1st year to connect with seniors via a more professional platform and get info about what all clubs are available in college and which of them are open to getting new members onboard. 
🛠I designed the backend for this website with Flask , while the frontend was built by other team members using basic HTML and CSS. We used SQLite as our database to store user information to enable automatic login and some other info like branch , year , interests as such.
📢All in all it was fun project built in the duration of 2 months and was also my 1st web development project!
